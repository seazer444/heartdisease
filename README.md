5 person project  
  Original PCA ANCOVA and AIC not mine - each created independently by respective group members 
  I integrated and compiled analyses into a cohesive & functional pipeline to resolve compatability/syntax issues and ensuring script functionality as a unit 
    troubleshooted & standardized code syntax for consistency and better integration/function as a coordinated analyses rather than seperate statistical methods
